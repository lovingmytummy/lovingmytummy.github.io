1 serving.

1. Cut, peel and pit the avocado. We recommend cutting the avocado in half and removing the flesh with a large spoon.
2. Cut it into chunks and place it in a bowl where you are going to beat it.
3. Add the milk, sweetener, and cinnamon. If you want to try it with banana, now is the time to add it too.
4. Whisk everything together (carefully so it doesn't splash).


## Tips:
- If you find it too thick or liquid, you can correct it by adding more milk or avocado.
- We recommend using cold milk so that the "baticate" is more refreshing.
- Optionally, you can also add a banana to give it a very tasty touch.
