1. **Prepare the potatoes:** Wash and dry the potatoes. If using baby potatoes, halve them; otherwise, cut into 1-inch chunks. Toss the potatoes in olive oil and coat evenly with the seasoning blend. 
2. **Preheat the air fryer:** Preheat to 200ÂºC (400ÂºF) for 3 minutes.
3. **Cook the potatoes:** Place the seasoned potatoes in the air fryer basket. Cook at 200ÂºC (400ÂºF) for 10 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through.
4. **Add the sausages:** After 10 minutes, add the sausages cutted in dices to the air fryer basket with the potatoes. Continue cooking at 200ÂºC (400ÂºF) for another 12-15 minutes, shaking the basket occasionally.
5. **Check for doneness:** Ensure the sausages are fully cooked (internal temperature of 71ÂºC/160ÂºF) and the potatoes are golden and crispy. 
6. **Serve and enjoy:** Plate the sausages with the roasted potatoes. Optional: Serve with gravy, Dijon mustard, or a side of peas for an authentic pub experience.

This dish draws inspiration from the British love of sausages ("bangers") and roasted potatoes. While traditionally served as "Bangers and Mash" with mashed potatoes, the roasted variation is a hearty alternative often found in pub fare, particularly in rural areas.
