1. **Crush the cookies:** Without opening the Oreo package, crush the cookies inside until they become fine crumbs.
2. **Add milk:** Open the package slightly and pour in milk until it fills the package. Mix gently by shaking.
3. **Insert the stick:** Pierce the package with the wooden stick, positioning it in the center.
4. **Freeze:** Place the package in the freezer and let it freeze completely (about 4-6 hours).
5. **Unwrap:** Once frozen, carefully remove the Oreo ice cream from the package.
6. **Coat with chocolate:** Dip the frozen ice cream into melted white chocolate, ensuring an even coating.
7. **Add toppings:** Immediately sprinkle crushed Oreo cookie pieces over the chocolate coating.
8. **Serve:** Let the coating set for a minute, then enjoy your homemade Oreo ice cream pop!
