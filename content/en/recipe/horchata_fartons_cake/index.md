1. Mix 400â€¯ml of horchata with the cornstarch and heat over medium heat, stirring constantly until it thickens. Reserve the remaining 200â€¯ml of horchata to soak the fartons.
2. Soak the gelatin sheets in cold water.
3. Drain the gelatin and add it to the thickened horchata cream. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it cool to room temperature.
4. Whip the very cold cream with the powdered sugar until it is semi-whipped (soft peaks).
5. Gently fold in the cooled horchata cream using smooth, enveloping motions to keep the mixture airy.
6. Slice the fartons in half lengthwise, lightly soak them in the reserved horchata, drain, and place them on the base of an 18â€¯cm ring mold on a serving plate.
7. Pour half of the cream over the fartons and smooth the surface.
8. Add a second layer of soaked fartons, then cover with the remaining cream and smooth again.
9. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours, preferably overnight.
10. The next day, remove the ring and sprinkle ground cinnamon to taste.
11. Serve very cold and enjoy this light and refreshing cake.
