For 2 servings.

1.  **Safety Preparation:** Ensure the salmon loin has been **previously frozen** (minimum 48 hours at -20Â°C) for food safety, as it will be consumed almost raw.
2.  **Prepare the Marinade:** In a small bowl, mix the **soy sauce**, **lemon** or lime **juice**, grated fresh **ginger**, and toasted sesame oil (if using).
3.  **Marinate the Salmon:** Submerge the clean salmon loin in the marinade. Let it marinate in the refrigerator for a maximum of **15 to 30 minutes**. Flip it halfway through.
4.  **Pat Dry and Coat with Sesame:** Remove the salmon from the marinade and **pat it very dry** with kitchen paper. Place the **sesame seeds** on a shallow plate and thoroughly coat the loin on all sides, pressing gently to make sure the seeds adhere firmly.
5.  **Sear the Tataki:** Heat the **vegetable oil** in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Once very hot, sear the salmon loin for **20 to 30 seconds on each of its four sides** (top, bottom, and both long sides). The exterior should be golden and crispy, but the interior must remain raw.
6.  **Slice and Serve:** Remove the salmon from the pan and let it rest for a couple of minutes. Using a very sharp knife, slice the loin into pieces about **0.5 to 1 cm** thick. Arrange the slices on a plate and sprinkle with chopped **chives**.
