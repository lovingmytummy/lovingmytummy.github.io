1. **Prepare the sardines:** Clean and fillet the sardines, removing the bones and skin, similar to how anchovies are prepared. Chill them in the refrigerator.
2. **Make the lemon butter:** In a small bowl, combine the softened butter with lemon juice and zest. Stir until smooth.
3. **Toast the bread:** Toast the bread slice until golden and crispy.
4. **Spread the butter:** Spread the lemon butter evenly over the toasted bread.
5. **Add the sardines:** Place the filleted sardines on top of the buttered toast.
6. **Garnish:** Sprinkle freshly chopped chives on top and season with salt to taste.
7. **Serve:** Serve immediately as a delicious appetizer or snack.
