Wash the spinach well and dry it. If the leaves are very large, chop them up a bit.

1. **Sauté the vegetables:** Finely chop the onion and garlic. In a frying pan with olive oil, sauté them over medium heat until they begin to turn golden.
2. **Cook the spinach:** Add the spinach to the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes until they wilt and are tender.
3. **Beat the eggs:** Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a large bowl with a pinch of salt.
4. **Mix:** Incorporate the contents of the pan (spinach, onion, and garlic) into the bowl with the beaten eggs and mix well until homogeneous.
5. **Cook the omelette:** Pour the mixture back into the pan over medium-low heat. Cook for about 5-7 minutes until the edges are set and golden.
6. **Flip:** With the help of a plate or a lid, carefully flip the omelette.
7. **Finish:** Cook for another 2-3 minutes on the other side until it is fully set to your liking.
