1. **Prepare Batter:** In a stand mixer, combine the egg white powder and water.
Beat until stiff peaks form. 
2. **Combine Ingredients:** Gently fold in the Greek yogurt, being careful not to overmix.
Add the chocolate chips and fold until just combined.
3. **Bake:** Transfer the batter into an oiled baking tin. Bake in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for about 30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown.
4. **Cool and Serve:** Allow to cool slightly. It may deflate a bit, which is normal. Tear or cut off a piece and toast for a delicious treat!
