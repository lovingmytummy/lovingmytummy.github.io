1. Preheat your smoker to 275Â°F (135Â°C).
2. Score the hot dogs vertically and horizontally to give them a rattlesnake tail appearance.
3. Slather the hot dogs with mustard to act as a binder for the seasoning.
4. In a small bowl, mix together the smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and ground dried chiles.
5. Coat the mustard-covered hot dogs thoroughly with the seasoning mix.
6. Place the hot dogs on the smoker for about 20 minutes, allowing the cuts to open up.
7. Remove the hot dogs and cut each into thirds. Place the pieces into a cast iron skillet.
8. Generously cover with Hickory Brown Sugar BBQ Sauce.
9. Return the skillet to the smoker at 300Â°F (150Â°C) for about 30 minutes, or until the sauce thickens and becomes sticky.
10. Remove from the smoker and let rest for a few minutes before serving.
