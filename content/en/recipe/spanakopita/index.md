1. **Prepare the filling:**
In a large pan, sautÃ© the spinach over medium heat until wilted (skip this step if using thawed frozen spinach). Allow it to cool slightly, then squeeze out excess liquid. In a mixing bowl, combine the spinach, feta cheese, spring onions, eggs, dill, parsley, mint nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Mix well until evenly combined.

2. **Layer the phyllo pastry:**
Preheat the oven to 180Â°C. Lightly grease a rectangular baking dish (approximately 23x33 cm). Lay one sheet of phyllo pastry on the base of the dish, allowing the edges to hang over. Brush with melted butter. Repeat with 4-5 more sheets, brushing each with butter, layering them evenly.

3. **Add the filling:**
Spread the spinach and feta mixture evenly over the phyllo base.

4. **Top with phyllo pastry:**
Layer the remaining phyllo sheets on top, brushing each with butter. Tuck in the overhanging edges neatly. Brush the top layer generously with butter and score the top with a sharp knife to create squares or diamond shapes (this makes it easier to cut after baking).

5. **Bake:**
Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes or until the top is golden and crispy.

6. **Serve:**
Allow the spanakopita to cool slightly before cutting into pieces. Serve warm or at room temperature.
