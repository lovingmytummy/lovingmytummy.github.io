1. **Prepare the bread**: Cut a thick slice from the loaf of bread. Using a small knife or spoon, create a small hollow or "hole" in the center of the bread slice, leaving a border around the edge.
2. **Optional toasting**: For a crispy texture, you can toast the bread slice at 180Â°C (350Â°F) for about 5 minutes, or until it's lightly golden.
3. **Fill with olives**: Place the sliced olives into the hollowed-out area of the bread. Arrange them so they fit snugly. 
4. **Drizzle with olive oil**: Generously drizzle extra virgin olive oil over the olives and the bread. Ensure that the oil fills the hollow and seeps into the surrounding bread.
5. **Serve**: Serve immediately, allowing the bread to soak up the olive oil and olive flavors.

**Optional**: Additional toppings like tomatoes, orange, cod, or cured meats.
