1. **Preheat the oven:** Preheat to 200Â°C (390Â°F). Place the butterflied sea bream on a baking dish and bake for 15 minutes.
2. **Prepare the garlic and chili oil:** While the fish is baking, heat the olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the garlic slices and cayenne peppers, and cook until the garlic turns golden. Remove from heat.
3. **Finish the sauce:** Remove the sea bream from the oven. Pour the garlic-chili oil mixture on top.
4. **Extract the juices:** Gently tilt or shake the baking dish to mix the fishâ€™s natural juices with the oil. Pour the juices back into the pan.
5. **Complete the sauce with paprika:** Heat the pan with the juices until boiling, then remove from heat. Stir in the sweet paprika until well combined. Pour the sauce over the fish.
6. **Serve:** Serve half the sea bream per person.

## Tips
- Pair this dish with roasted potatoes, steamed vegetables, or crusty bread to soak up the flavorful sauce.
- Adjust the cayenne peppers based on your spice tolerance.
- The fish can also be cooked in the skillet which is faster and equally flavorful, ideal for when you don't want to use the oven.
- Be careful not to overcook the garlic nor paprika to avoid bitterness.
