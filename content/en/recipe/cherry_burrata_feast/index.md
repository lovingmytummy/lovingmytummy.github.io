A vibrant savory tart/pizza that combines the sweetness of marinated tomatoes with the creaminess of fresh burrata.

1. **Marinate the tomatoes:** Cut the cherry tomatoes in half. In a bowl, mix them with olive oil, soy sauce, balsamic glaze, honey, salt, pepper, and your favorite spices. Let them rest while you prepare the base.
2. **Prepare the spicy oil:** Finely mince the garlic and mix it with a generous splash of olive oil and the chili flakes.
3. **Prepare the base:** Roll out the shortcrust pastry on parchment paper. Or prepare a [pizza dough following this recipe]({{< relref "recipe/flammkuchen" >}}). Brush the entire surface of the dough with the spicy garlic oil you just prepared.
4. **Assembly before baking:** Place the marinated cherry tomatoes over the dough (you can add a little bit of the marinade juice, but not too much to avoid making the crust soggy). Add the anchovies if you decide to use them.
5. **Bake:** Place in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for about 20 minutes or until the edges of the pastry are golden brown.
6. **The final touch:** Remove the tart from the oven and, just before serving, place the burrata in the center and break it open so it spreads over the hot tomatoes.
