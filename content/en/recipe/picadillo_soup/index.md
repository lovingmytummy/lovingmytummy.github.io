1. **Heat the broth:** In a medium pot, bring the chicken broth to a gentle boil over medium heat.
2. **Cook the noodles:** Add the small pasta noodles to the boiling broth. Stir occasionally and cook for 3-5 minutes, or until tender (refer to the pasta package instructions for exact timing).
3. **Add the ham and egg:** Stir in the finely chopped serrano ham and diced hard-boiled eggs. Allow them to warm through for 1-2 minutes.
4. **Add the peppermint:** Add the fresh peppermint leaves to the soup just before serving to infuse it with their aroma and flavor.
5. **Serve:** Ladle the soup into bowls and serve hot, with crusty bread if desired.

## Tips
- You can use store-bought or homemade chicken broth for the base.
- Adjust the amount of noodles, ham, and egg according to your preference.
- For extra flavor, you can sautÃ© the ham lightly before adding it to the soup.
