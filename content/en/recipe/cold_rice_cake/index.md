1.  **Prepare the Rice Cake Base:** In a bowl, **crush the puffed rice cakes** until you get crumbs (you can use your hands or a fork). If you want a more compact base, you can add a splash of milk or a plant-based drink to slightly moisten the crumbs, helping them compact better.

2.  **Form the Base:** On a plate or in a mold (you can use a dessert ring to shape it), press the crushed rice cake crumbs firmly onto the bottom to create a uniform and compact base for the cake.

3.  **Prepare the Creamy Filling:** In another bowl, mix the **light Greek yogurt**, **light cream cheese**, and the **scoop of protein powder**. Whisk well until you get a smooth, lump-free cream.

4.  **Assemble the Cake:** Pour the creamy filling over the rice cake base in the mold or on the plate. Spread it evenly with a spatula.

5.  **Add Fruit and Decorate:** Decorate the top of the cake with your **fruit of choice**. You can arrange it decoratively or simply scatter it over.

6.  **Chill:** Cover the cake with plastic wrap (or place it in an airtight container) and chill in the refrigerator for at least **2-3 hours**, or ideally overnight, for the filling to set and the cake to acquire a firm consistency.

7.  **Serve:** Once the cake is firm and well-chilled, remove it from the refrigerator (if using a mold, carefully unmold it) and serve.
