For 1 serving.

1.  **Prepare the dough:** Dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it rest for 5-10 minutes until a foam forms. In a separate bowl, mix the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and oil. Mix and knead on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Cover and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.

2.  **Prepare the filling and shape:** Shred the cheese and mix it. Once the dough has risen, roll it out into an oval shape. Place the cheese in the center and roll the long edges inward, forming a "boat" shape. Pinch the ends to seal them tightly so the cheese doesn't leak out.

3.  **Bake:** Preheat the oven to 220Â°C (425Â°F). Place the khachapuri on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the edges of the dough with the beaten egg. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the dough is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling.

4.  **Add the egg and butter:** Take the khachapuri out of the oven. With a spoon, make a well in the melted cheese and crack the fresh egg into the center. Return to the oven for another 3-5 minutes, or until the egg white is set but the yolk is still runny.

5.  **Serve:** Remove from the oven and immediately add a knob of butter on top of the egg. Serve at once. To eat, mix the yolk, butter, and cheese, and use the bread edges to dip into the creamy mixture.
