* To sweeten recipes, it's better to use crushed dates or pure honey instead of sugar or artificial sweeteners.
* Almost all oven recipes can also be made in the air fryer.
* When I specify **olive oil** I mean always **extra virgin olive oil (AOVE)**.
* **Cutting fresh herbs:** Cutting fresh herbs should be done with a very sharp knife, taking all the time needed to ensure they are sliced, not crushed. Ideally, you want the knife to glide over the cutting board rather than mash the herbs.
