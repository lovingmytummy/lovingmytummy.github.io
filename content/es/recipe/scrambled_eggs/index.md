1. **Crack the eggs** into a bowl and whisk them well until the yolks and whites are fully blended. Add a pinch of salt and pepper, and if desired, a splash of milk or cream for a creamier texture.
2. **Heat a non-stick skillet** over medium-low heat and add the butter or oil. Let it melt, coating the pan evenly.
3. **Pour the eggs into the pan** once the butter is melted and starts to foam.
4. **Stir gently and frequently** with a spatula. Allow the eggs to cook slowly, moving them around the pan so they cook evenly.
5. **When the eggs are mostly set** but still slightly runny, remove the pan from the heat. The residual heat will finish cooking the eggs.
6. **Taste and adjust seasoning** if needed, decorate with basil, then serve immediately.

Serve your scrambled eggs on toast, with vegetables, or as part of a larger breakfast.
