1. **Prepare the potatoes:** Wash, dry, and cut the potato into 1/4" strips. Toss them in peanut oil until evenly coated.
2. **Air fry:** Cook in an air fryer at 200Â°C (400Â°F) for 15 minutes until golden brown.
3. **Seasoning blend:** Mix all the remaining ingredients into a cajun seasoning blend.
4. **Toss with spices:** Toss the fries with 1/2 to 3/4 of the seasoning blend. Return them to the air fryer for 4-6 minutes at 200Â°C (400Â°F).
5. **Final touch:** Sprinkle the remaining seasoning and serve hot.
