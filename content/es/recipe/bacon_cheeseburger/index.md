1. **Prepare the bacon:** Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook the bacon slices until crispy, about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove and place on paper towels to drain excess grease.
2. **Form the burger patty:** Shape the ground beef into a round patty, slightly larger than the bun. Press a small indent in the center with your thumb. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
3. **Cook the patty:** Heat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the patty for about 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare (adjust the time for your preferred doneness). During the last minute of cooking, place the cheddar slice on top to melt. Cover the skillet or close the grill lid to help the cheese melt evenly.
4. **Toast the bun:** Lightly butter the inside of the bun and toast it in the skillet or on the grill for 1-2 minutes until golden.
5. **Assemble the burger:** Spread your desired condiments on the bottom bun. Place the lettuce on the bun, followed by the cooked patty with melted cheese. Add the crispy bacon, tomato slice, pickles, and onion. Top with the upper bun.
6. **Serve and enjoy:** Serve immediately with a side like chips or a small salad.
