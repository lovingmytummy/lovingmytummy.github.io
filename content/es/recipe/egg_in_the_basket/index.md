1. **Cut a hole in the bread:** Use a round cookie cutter or the rim of a glass to cut a hole in the center of the bread slice (about 5-7 cm in diameter). Keep the hole for later use if you want to toast it separately.
2. **Heat a skillet** over medium heat and add the butter or oil, allowing it to melt and coat the pan.
3. **Place the bread slice** in the pan, then crack the egg into the hole in the center of the bread.
4. **Cook the egg:** Let the egg cook until the white is set and the yolk is still runny, about 2-3 minutes. If you prefer a fully cooked yolk, cover the pan with a lid for a minute to help it cook through.
5. **Season:** Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.
6. **Optional:** Toast the piece of bread you removed earlier in the pan or use it for dipping!
