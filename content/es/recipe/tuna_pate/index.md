1. Drain the oil or water from the canned tuna using a strainer. Mash the tuna with a fork until it starts to form a paste.
2. Peel and finely chop the shallot into very small pieces, almost unnoticeable. Finely chop the capers (optional) and parsley as well.
3. In a bowl, mix the tuna with the lemon juice. Add the shallot, capers, parsley, mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard (optional). Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Mash everything well with a fork until you achieve a creaminess and homogeneous paste.
4. Cover with plastic wrap, ensuring that the wrap is in direct contact with the mixture, and let it rest in the refrigerator for 2 hours.

Serve with crackers or toasted bread for spreading or dipping. 
It's also a fantastic option for filling sandwiches or serving with vegetable cruditÃ©s.
