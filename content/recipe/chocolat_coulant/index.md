## Preparation

1. **Preheat the oven:** Preheat to 200°C (390°F). Grease four ramekins with butter and dust them with cocoa powder or flour. Set aside.
2. **Melt chocolate and butter:** In a heatproof bowl, combine the chocolate and butter. Melt them over a bain-marie (double boiler) or in short intervals in the microwave, stirring frequently until smooth. Let it cool slightly.
3. **Prepare the egg mixture:** In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar until the mixture becomes pale and slightly fluffy.
4. **Combine with the chocolate:** Gradually fold the melted chocolate and butter mixture into the egg mixture until fully combined.
5. **Add the flour:** Sift the flour and salt into the mixture and gently fold it in until you have a smooth batter.
6. **Fill the ramekins:** Divide the batter evenly among the prepared ramekins, filling each about 3/4 full.
Bake: Place the ramekins on a baking tray and bake for 8-10 minutes. The edges should be set, but the center should remain soft. Adjust the time based on your oven, as overbaking will lose the molten center.
7. **Serve:** Let the cakes cool for 1-2 minutes before gently inverting them onto plates. Serve immediately with a dusting of powdered sugar, fresh berries, or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

## Tips
- Adding a chocolate square in the center ensures an extra molten core.
- To ensure the molten center, you can refrigerate the batter for an hour before baking.
- Test one cake first to get the perfect baking time for your oven.
