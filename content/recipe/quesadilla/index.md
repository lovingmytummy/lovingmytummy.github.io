As the main ingredient, you can use your favourite protein (chicken, turkey, tuna, salmon, etc.).

1. Place one tortilla in the air fryer. Cover with the main ingredient (e.g., chicken) and half of the cheese, spreading them evenly.
2. Cover with the second tortilla. Place a metal rack on top to prevent the tortilla from flying off.
3. Set the air fryer to 190Â°C (375Â°F) for 6 minutes. 
4. Halfway through, remove the rack, flip the quesadilla, cover with the remaining shredded cheese, and sprinkle with oregano.
5. Cut into portions and serve.
