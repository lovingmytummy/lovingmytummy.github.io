## Prepare the Base

1. In a blender or food processor, break the cookies into small pieces and blend until finely crushed.
2. Melt the butter and mix it with the crushed cookies. Stir until the mixture resembles wet sand.
3. Line the base of a 20 cm (8-inch) springform pan with parchment paper to prevent sticking. Press the cookie and butter mixture firmly into the bottom of the pan using the back of a spoon to create a compact and even base. Refrigerate the pan while you prepare the filling.


## Prepare the Filling
1. In a saucepan, combine the cream cheese, heavy cream, and sugar. Heat gently over low heat, stirring continuously until the mixture is smooth and fully combined. Do not let it boil.
2. Add the dessert gelatine according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and stir briefly to ensure it is well incorporated with the rest of the ingredients.

## Assemble the Cheesecake

1. Remove the pan from the refrigerator and carefully pour the cream cheese mixture over the chilled cookie base. Smooth the surface with a spatula to ensure it is even.
2. Cover the cheesecake with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to set and achieve the desired consistency.

## Add the Topping (optional)

1. Once the cheesecake has set, carefully remove it from the springform pan.
2. Generously spread 250g of strawberry jam over the surface of the cheesecake to add color and a delicious fruity flavor.

*Notes:* 
- If you're using powdered gelatin instead of sheets, you'll need to convert the amount accordingly. Typically, one sheet of gelatin is equivalent to about 1 teaspoon of powdered gelatin.
