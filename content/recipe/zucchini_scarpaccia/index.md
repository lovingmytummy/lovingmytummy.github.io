1. Slice the zucchinis into thin rounds using a mandoline or a knife.
2. Thinly slice the onion into julienne strips.
3. Place the zucchinis and onion in a colander over a deep plate or bowl. Add salt, mix well, and let it sit for at least two hours with some weight on top.
4. Preheat the oven to 220Â°C (428Â°F).
5. In a large bowl, add the flour and the liquid released by the zucchinis, one tablespoon of olive oil, black pepper, and Parmesan cheese if desired. Optionally add garlic and onion powder. Mix well.
6. Add the zucchinis and onion to the mixture and combine thoroughly. Pour the mixture into a 35x25 centimeter (14x10 inch) baking tray lined with parchment paper and greased with oil. Press the mixture down lightly with your hands to spread and compact it; it should be about two centimeters thick (approximately 0.8 inches).
7. Drizzle some olive oil on top and bake for 40 minutes or until the top is nicely golden. 
8. Let the scarpaccia cool on a wire rack. Optionally, you can flip it over and brown the other side by placing it under the grill in the top part of the oven for about five minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
