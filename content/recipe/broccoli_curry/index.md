1. **Prepare the broccoli:** Cut the broccoli into small florets. Steam or boil the broccoli florets for 3-5 minutes, until tender but still firm (1 minutes for crispy). Set aside.
2. **Sauté the aromatics:** Heat a bit of oil in a large skillet or pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes, until softened. Add the minced garlic and ground cumin, and cook for another minute, stirring constantly.
3. **Make the curry base:** Stir in the tomato paste and curry powder, cooking for 2 minutes to develop the flavors. Gradually add a bit of water (about 1/2 cup) to create a smooth, saucy consistency.
Add yogurt: Lower the heat and stir in the Greek yogurt, mixing well to avoid curdling. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
1. **Combine with broccoli:** Add the steamed broccoli florets to the sauce, stirring gently to coat them evenly. Cook for 2-3 minutes to warm everything through.
2. **Add the walnuts:** Sprinkle the chopped walnuts over the curry and stir lightly to incorporate.
3. **Serve:** Serve hot with steamed rice, naan bread, or as a standalone dish.
