Loaded fries is a dish consisting of French fries topped with a combination of cheese, sauces, meat (commonly bacon) and vegetables.

Ingredients for 1 serving.

1. **Prepare the fries:** Cut the potatos into fries. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) or heat the oil in a frying pan.
2. **Cook the fries:** If baking, toss the fries in a little olive oil and spread them on a baking sheet. Bake for 25-30 minutes, turning halfway through until golden and crispy. If frying, fry them in batches until crispy and drain on paper towels.
3. **Prepare the meat:** If using minced meat, season the meat with salt, pepper, and your favorite spices (e.g., Cajun), then fry it in a frying pan or incorporating it with the fries and bake for 5 additional minutes to 190°C (375°F). 
4. **Season:** While the fries are still hot, season with salt and pepper.
5. **Add toppings:** Spread the fries on a serving plate. Sprinkle the shredded cheese over the fries, then add the crumbled bacon and green onion.
6. **Melt the cheese:** (Optional) Return the fries to the oven for a few (2) minutes until the cheese is melted.
7. **Serve:** Drizzle with sour cream and add any extra toppings you like such as jalapeños, guacamole, salsa, fried onion, chopped chives, etc.
