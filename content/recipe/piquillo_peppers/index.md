1. **Prepare the Garlic and Parsley:** Finely mince the garlic and chop the parsley.

2. **Assemble the Peppers:** Place the drained piquillo peppers on a serving plate.

3. **Season:** Sprinkle the minced garlic and chopped parsley evenly over the peppers.

4. **Dress with Olive Oil:** Drizzle the olive oil generously over the peppers, making sure each pepper is coated. Add salt to taste.

5. **Marinate and Serve:** Let the peppers sit for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to blend. Serve at room temperature as a tapa or side dish.
