1. **Prepare the cucumber:** Grate the cucumber and place it in a cheesecloth or a clean kitchen towel. Squeeze out as much liquid as possible to prevent the sauce from becoming watery.
2. **Mix the ingredients:** In a medium bowl, combine the yogurt, grated cucumber, garlic powder, onion powder, dill, parsley, olive oil, and lemon juice. Stir well until all ingredients are fully blended.
3. **Season and chill:** Add salt to taste, along with pepper if desired. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow flavors to meld.
4. **Serve:** Enjoy as a dip with pita bread, as a sauce for gyros or grilled meats, or as a refreshing spread.
