1. Place the burger patty on the wheat tortilla and press it down well so that it almost covers the tortilla and sticks to it.
2. Fry the egg on a griddle or in a pan.
3. Cook the burger on the griddle with the tortilla facing down.
4. Flip it over and add a slice of your favorite cheese and cover with a lid to melt the cheese.
5. Add your favorite sauce (BBQ, mustard, ketchup,...), and finally, place the fried egg on top.
