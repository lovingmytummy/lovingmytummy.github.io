1. **Prepare the Pork:** Cut the pork into long strips or chunks, each about 5 to 7.5 cm thick. Avoid trimming the fat as it helps keep the pork juicy and flavorful during cooking.
  
2. **Make the Marinade:** In a bowl, combine sugar, salt, five-spice powder, white pepper, sesame oil, Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, molasses (or dark soy), garlic, and food coloring (if using). For an extra layer of flavor, add 1 teaspoon of oyster sauce. Reserve about 2 tablespoons of this marinade for basting later.

3. **Marinate the Pork:** Rub the pork pieces generously with the remaining marinade, ensuring all surfaces are well-coated. Cover the pork with plastic wrap or transfer to a resealable bag, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or preferably overnight for optimal flavor infusion.
4. **Preheat the Oven:** Preheat your oven to 240°C (475°F). If using convection, lower the temperature by 15°C (25°F) to avoid overcooking.

5. **Set Up for Roasting:** Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil for easy cleanup and place a metal rack on top. This allows the pork to cook evenly by circulating heat around the meat. Pour 1 ½ cups of water into the pan under the rack to prevent any drippings from burning.
   
6. **Roast the Pork:** Place the pork pieces on the rack, ensuring they’re spaced out. Roast in the oven at 240°C (475°F) for the first 10 minutes. After this, reduce the temperature to 190°C (375°F). Continue roasting for 25 minutes, flipping the pork halfway through. If the water in the pan evaporates, add another cup to prevent burning. 
7. **Prepare the Glaze:** While the pork is roasting, combine the reserved marinade with the honey (or maltose) and 1 tablespoon of hot water. Heat the honey slightly if needed to make it easier to mix.

8. **Baste and Finish Roasting:** After 40 minutes of roasting, baste the pork with the honey mixture. Flip the pork and baste the other side. Continue roasting for another 10 minutes until the pork is deeply caramelized and sticky. For extra caramelization, you can broil the pork for 2–3 minutes at the end, keeping a close eye on it to avoid burning.

9. **Check for Doneness:** The pork should reach an internal temperature of 70°C (160°F) for full doneness, but you can remove it at 60°C (145°F) for a slightly juicier texture and let it rest for 3 minutes. Use a meat thermometer for accuracy.

10. **Rest and Serve:** Remove the pork from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing. This helps the juices redistribute for moist, tender meat. Baste with any remaining glaze just before serving.
