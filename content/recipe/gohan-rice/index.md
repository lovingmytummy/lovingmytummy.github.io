Use round or bomba rice (avoid basmati or long-grain rice).

1. Measure the rice and place it in a pot.
2. Add plenty of water to the pot, stir quickly 2 or 3 times, and then discard the water.
3. Add water again and wash the rice by hand, repeating this process 3-6 times (or until the water runs clear), and discarding the water each time.
4. Add an equal amount of water to the washed rice, cover with a lid, and if you have time, I recommend letting the rice soak for 30 minutes.
5. Place it over medium heat and wait for the water in the pot to start boiling (youâ€™ll hear bubbling sounds or see foam overflowing from the lid).
6. Once it starts boiling, continue cooking over medium heat for 2 minutes.
7. Then, reduce the heat to low and cook for an additional 9 minutes. Finally, check that thereâ€™s no water left inside. If thereâ€™s no water, the rice is ready. If you need to open the lid to check, remember to replace it immediately and heat over medium heat for 5-10 seconds to reheat the pot.
8. After cooking, leave the lid on for 10 minutes without opening it to let the rice steam. This ensures the rice cooks evenly and becomes fluffy.
9. After steaming, open the lid and gently mix the rice from the bottom with a rice paddle to fluff it up.
