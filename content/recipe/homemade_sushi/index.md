- **Tip:** The best rice for making sushi is the Japonica variety, which is short-grain and sticky, and can be found in all Asian stores and many supermarkets. If you don't have time to buy it, you can also use Bomba rice, which has similar characteristics.

1. Cook the rice and refrigerate it in the fridge.
2. Cover an egg carton with plastic wrap.
3. Place small pieces of salmon in each compartment.
4. Add avocado on top and the cream cheese (optional).
5. Cover everything well with cold, cooked rice from the refrigerator.
6. Cover everything with square pieces of nori seaweed.
7. Use a cutting board or plate to flip the egg carton over, and gently unmold.
