Cut butter into ½ inch cubes, then set aside in the freezer to keep cold. Meanwhile prepare the rest of the ingredients. Weigh the flour and set aside in the freezer or fridge as well. The colder the ingredients, the better. Grind walnuts very finely with a mouli grater (I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find walnut meal). Don&amp;rsquo;t use a food processor, the chopped pieces will still come out too big.</description></item><item><title>Banana icecream</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/banana_icecream/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/banana_icecream/</guid><description>Blend the bananas with the yogurt and peanut butter in a blender.

Tips If you use unsalted butter, add 1/8 teaspoon of salt. You can substitute the butter by oil (2-3 teaspoons) or mashed banana. If you want a larger portion, simply double the recipe and cook it in a medium-sized microwave-safe bowl, transforming this receipt in a bowl cake. Preparation In a microwave-safe mug, melt the butter in the microwave for about 20-30 seconds. Mix all the dry ingredients thoroughly until well combined.</description></item><item><title>Mushrooms in sauce with egg</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/mushrooms_sauce_eggs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/mushrooms_sauce_eggs/</guid><description>Ingredients for 2 servings.
