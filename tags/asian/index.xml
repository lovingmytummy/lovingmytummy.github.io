Avoid trimming the fat as it helps keep the pork juicy and flavorful during cooking.
Make the Marinade: In a bowl, combine sugar, salt, five-spice powder, white pepper, sesame oil, Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, molasses (or dark soy), garlic, and food coloring (if using). For an extra layer of flavor, add 1 teaspoon of oyster sauce.</description></item><item><title>Chicken kebab</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/chicken_kebab/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/chicken_kebab/</guid><description>In a bowl, mix all the ingredients (except the pineapple) with the chicken.

Measure the rice and place it in a pot. Add plenty of water to the pot, stir quickly 2 or 3 times, and then discard the water. Add water again and wash the rice by hand, repeating this process 3-6 times (or until the water runs clear), and discarding the water each time. Add an equal amount of water to the washed rice, cover with a lid, and if you have time, I recommend letting the rice soak for 30 minutes.</description></item><item><title>Homemade Sushi</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/homemade_sushi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/homemade_sushi/</guid><description>Tip: The best rice for making sushi is the Japonica variety, which is short-grain and sticky, and can be found in all Asian stores and many supermarkets. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have time to buy it, you can also use Bomba rice, which has similar characteristics. Cook the rice and refrigerate it in the fridge. Cover an egg carton with plastic wrap. Place small pieces of salmon in each compartment. Add avocado on top and the cream cheese (optional).</description></item><item><title>Oat and Chocolate cookies</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/oat_chocolate_cookies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/oat_chocolate_cookies/</guid><description>You can use wheat flour or any other kind of flour. I even recommend using ground oats as flour, in addition to the oat flakes.
Preheat the oven with two baking trays lined with parchment paper. Mix the butter, sugar, and egg in a bowl. Add the remaining ingredients to the mixture except for the chocolate, and mix with a dough utensil until fully combined.
