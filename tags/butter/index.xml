If desired, add some grated Parmesan for extra flavor. Slice the bread: Cut the baguette or loaf into slices, making sure not to cut all the way through so the slices stay connected at the bottom.

You can also make the dish entirely with fresh salmon or entirely with smoked salmon by cooking half of it.
Season the salmon on both sides lightly with a bit of salt. Steam in a steamer basket until just cooked, about 8 minutes. Once cooked, remove from heat and let cool. In a medium-sized bowl, mash together with a fork the butter and the olive oil until very smooth.</description></item></channel></rss>
