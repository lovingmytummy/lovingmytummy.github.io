If desired, add some grated Parmesan for extra flavor. Slice the bread: Cut the baguette or loaf into slices, making sure not to cut all the way through so the slices stay connected at the bottom. Spread the garlic butter: Using a knife or spoon, spread the garlic butter mixture between each slice and across the top of the bread.</description></item><item><title>Salmon rillettes</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/salmon_rillettes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/salmon_rillettes/</guid><description>For 6 servings. You can also make the dish entirely with fresh salmon or entirely with smoked salmon by cooking half of it.
Season the salmon on both sides lightly with a bit of salt. Steam in a steamer basket until just cooked, about 8 minutes. Once cooked, remove from heat and let cool. In a medium-sized bowl, mash together with a fork the butter and the olive oil until very smooth.</description></item></channel></rss>
