If desired, add some grated Parmesan for extra flavor. Slice the bread: Cut the baguette or loaf into slices, making sure not to cut all the way through so the slices stay connected at the bottom. Spread the garlic butter: Using a knife or spoon, spread the garlic butter mixture between each slice and across the top of the bread.</description></item><item><title>Piquillo peppers</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/piquillo_peppers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/piquillo_peppers/</guid><description>Prepare the Garlic and Parsley: Finely mince the garlic and chop the parsley.

Add spaghetti and cook until nearly al dente (like, just one minute shy of being done). SautÃ© the garlic: Meanwhile, about 3 minutes after you add the pasta to the boiling water, heat the olive oil in a large sautÃ© pan over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes and sautÃ© for 3 to 5 minutes, or until it is lightly golden.</description></item><item><title>Stuffed mushrooms with garlic and parsley</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/stuffed_mushrooms_garlic_parsley/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/stuffed_mushrooms_garlic_parsley/</guid><description>Remove the stems and thoroughly wash the mushrooms to eliminate any dirt or sand. It&amp;rsquo;s important not to remove the skin in this case, as they could burn (especially if cooked in a pan). Take a handful of parsley and as many garlic cloves as you think necessary, depending on how many mushrooms you want to prepare. Finely chop the garlic and parsley, and let them marinate with a good drizzle of olive oil.</description></item></channel></rss>
