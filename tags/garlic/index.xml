If desired, add some grated Parmesan for extra flavor. Slice the bread: Cut the baguette or loaf into slices, making sure not to cut all the way through so the slices stay connected at the bottom.

Heat the oil over medium heat. Peel the garlic cloves and slice them thinly. Lower the heat and add the garlic and cayenne peppers, frying until the garlic is golden brown. Remove the pan from the heat and add a teaspoon of paprika, stirring to prevent it from burning. Add the prawns and let them cook in the residual heat. If using shrimp, cook for an additional minute or two over the heat until they change color.</description></item><item><title>Piquillo peppers</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/piquillo_peppers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/piquillo_peppers/</guid><description>Prepare the Garlic and Parsley: Finely mince the garlic and chop the parsley.

Optionally add the paprika and mix well. Prepare the quails: Clean the quails and season them with salt and pepper.

Add spaghetti and cook until nearly al dente (like, just one minute shy of being done). SautÃ© the garlic: Meanwhile, about 3 minutes after you add the pasta to the boiling water, heat the olive oil in a large sautÃ© pan over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes and sautÃ© for 3 to 5 minutes, or until it is lightly golden.</description></item><item><title>Stuffed mushrooms with garlic and parsley</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/stuffed_mushrooms_garlic_parsley/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/stuffed_mushrooms_garlic_parsley/</guid><description>Remove the stems and thoroughly wash the mushrooms to eliminate any dirt or sand. It&amp;rsquo;s important not to remove the skin in this case, as they could burn (especially if cooked in a pan). Take a handful of parsley and as many garlic cloves as you think necessary, depending on how many mushrooms you want to prepare. Finely chop the garlic and parsley, and let them marinate with a good drizzle of olive oil.</description></item></channel></rss>
