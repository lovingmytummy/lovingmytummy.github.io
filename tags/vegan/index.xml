Cut, peel and pit the avocado. We recommend cutting the avocado in half and removing the flesh with a large spoon. Cut it into chunks and place it in a bowl where you are going to beat it. Add the milk, sweetener, and cinnamon. If you want to try it with banana, now is the time to add it too. Whisk everything together (carefully so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t splash). Tips: If you find it too thick or liquid, you can correct it by adding more milk or avocado.</description></item><item><title>Blueberries &amp; banana crumpets</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/blueberries_banana_crumpets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/blueberries_banana_crumpets/</guid><description>Mash the bananas, add the flour and baking powder, and knead well.

Measure the rice and place it in a pot. Add plenty of water to the pot, stir quickly 2 or 3 times, and then discard the water. Add water again and wash the rice by hand, repeating this process 3-6 times (or until the water runs clear), and discarding the water each time. Add an equal amount of water to the washed rice, cover with a lid, and if you have time, I recommend letting the rice soak for 30 minutes.</description></item><item><title>Mini Chocolate Tartlets</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/mini_chocolate_tartlets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/mini_chocolate_tartlets/</guid><description>For 2 small tartlets.

Slice off the top and peel the outer layer. Place the onion face down and cut it into quarters, then quarter it again once or twice more, depending on the size of the onion. Soak in ice water: Let the cut onion sit in ice water for a few minutes. This helps the layers separate and gives the onion a crisp texture.</description></item><item><title>Piquillo peppers</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/piquillo_peppers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/piquillo_peppers/</guid><description>Prepare the Garlic and Parsley: Finely mince the garlic and chop the parsley.
