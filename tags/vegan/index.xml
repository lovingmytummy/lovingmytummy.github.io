Healthy and vegan, it makes a tasty light lunch or supper.
Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and line a baking tray with baking parchment. Slice the cauliflower into two 1-inch steaks – use the middle part as it’s larger, and save the rest for another time. Rub the paprika and 1⁄2 tbsp oil over the steaks and season.</description></item><item><title>Chocolate &amp; Banana bar</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/chocolate_banana_bar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/chocolate_banana_bar/</guid><description>Place the banana slices on a board or tray lined with parchment or baking paper.

Measure the rice and place it in a pot. Add plenty of water to the pot, stir quickly 2 or 3 times, and then discard the water. Add water again and wash the rice by hand, repeating this process 3-6 times (or until the water runs clear), and discarding the water each time. Add an equal amount of water to the washed rice, cover with a lid, and if you have time, I recommend letting the rice soak for 30 minutes.</description></item><item><title>Mini Chocolate Tartlets</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/mini_chocolate_tartlets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/mini_chocolate_tartlets/</guid><description>For 2 small tartlets.
Combine the cornflakes with the melted chocolate. Press the mixture firmly into two pre-greased mini tart molds to form the base. Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes. Fill the tarts with peanut butter and sprinkle chopped walnuts on top. Finally, cover with more melted chocolate (use as much as chocolate as needed). Let them cool in the fridge.

Slice off the top and peel the outer layer. Place the onion face down and cut it into quarters, then quarter it again once or twice more, depending on the size of the onion. Soak in ice water: Let the cut onion sit in ice water for a few minutes. This helps the layers separate and gives the onion a crisp texture.</description></item></channel></rss>
