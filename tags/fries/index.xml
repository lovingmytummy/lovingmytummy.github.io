Ingredients for 1 serving.
Prepare the fries: Cut the potatos into fries. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) or heat the oil in a frying pan. Cook the fries: If baking, toss the fries in a little olive oil and spread them on a baking sheet. Bake for 25-30 minutes, turning halfway through until golden and crispy.</description></item></channel></rss>
