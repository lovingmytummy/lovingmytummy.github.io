Tips If you use unsalted butter, add 1/8 teaspoon of salt. You can substitute the butter by oil (2-3 teaspoons) or mashed banana. If you want a larger portion, simply double the recipe and cook it in a medium-sized microwave-safe bowl, transforming this receipt in a bowl cake. Preparation In a microwave-safe mug, melt the butter in the microwave for about 20-30 seconds. Mix all the dry ingredients thoroughly until well combined.</description></item><item><title>No-Bake Cheesecake</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/no_bake_cheesecake/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/no_bake_cheesecake/</guid><description>Prepare the Base In a blender or food processor, break the cookies into small pieces and blend until finely crushed.
