Combine the cornflakes with the melted chocolate. Press the mixture firmly into two pre-greased mini tart molds to form the base. Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes. Fill the tarts with peanut butter and sprinkle chopped walnuts on top. Finally, cover with more melted chocolate (use as much as chocolate as needed). Let them cool in the fridge.

Tips If you use unsalted butter, add 1/8 teaspoon of salt. You can substitute the butter by oil (2-3 teaspoons) or mashed banana. If you want a larger portion, simply double the recipe and cook it in a medium-sized microwave-safe bowl, transforming this receipt in a bowl cake. Preparation In a microwave-safe mug, melt the butter in the microwave for about 20-30 seconds. Mix all the dry ingredients thoroughly until well combined.</description></item><item><title>Taco burger</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/taco_burger/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/taco_burger/</guid><description>Place the burger patty on the wheat tortilla and press it down well so that it almost covers the tortilla and sticks to it. Fry the egg on a griddle or in a pan. Cook the burger on the griddle with the tortilla facing down. Flip it over and add a slice of your favorite cheese and cover with a lid to melt the cheese. Add your favorite sauce (BBQ, mustard, ketchup,&amp;hellip;), and finally, place the fried egg on top.</description></item></channel></rss>
