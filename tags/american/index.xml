Combine the cornflakes with the melted chocolate. Press the mixture firmly into two pre-greased mini tart molds to form the base. Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes. Fill the tarts with peanut butter and sprinkle chopped walnuts on top. Finally, cover with more melted chocolate (use as much as chocolate as needed). Let them cool in the fridge.

Fry the egg on a griddle or in a pan. Cook the burger on the griddle with the tortilla facing down. Flip it over and add a slice of your favorite cheese and cover with a lid to melt the cheese. Add your favorite sauce (BBQ, mustard, ketchup,&amp;hellip;), and finally, place the fried egg on top.</description></item></channel></rss>
