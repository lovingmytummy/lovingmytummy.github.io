Tips If you use unsalted butter, add 1/8 teaspoon of salt. You can substitute the butter by oil (2-3 teaspoons) or mashed banana. If you want a larger portion, simply double the recipe and cook it in a medium-sized microwave-safe bowl, transforming this receipt in a bowl cake. Preparation In a microwave-safe mug, melt the butter in the microwave for about 20-30 seconds. Mix all the dry ingredients thoroughly until well combined.</description></item><item><title>Outback Blooming Onion</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/outback_blooming_onion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/outback_blooming_onion/</guid><description>Prepare the Onion: Keep the root of the onion intact to hold it together. Slice off the top and peel the outer layer. Place the onion face down and cut it into quarters, then quarter it again once or twice more, depending on the size of the onion. Soak in ice water: Let the cut onion sit in ice water for a few minutes. This helps the layers separate and gives the onion a crisp texture.</description></item><item><title>Taco burger</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/taco_burger/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/taco_burger/</guid><description>Place the burger patty on the wheat tortilla and press it down well so that it almost covers the tortilla and sticks to it.
