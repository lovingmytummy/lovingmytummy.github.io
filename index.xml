Cut butter into ¬Ω inch cubes, then set aside in the freezer to keep cold. Meanwhile prepare the rest of the ingredients. Weigh the flour and set aside in the freezer or fridge as well. The colder the ingredients, the better. Grind walnuts very finely with a mouli grater (I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find walnut meal). Don&amp;rsquo;t use a food processor, the chopped pieces will still come out too big.</description></item><item><title>Bruschetta</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/bruschetta/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/bruschetta/</guid><description>Spread the tomato over the slices of bread.

Add your own toppings for extra fun.
Pull the green hulls out of the strawberries. If they are still quite hard, cut them in half or quarters with a table knife. Tip them into a flat-bottomed dish. Use a potato masher to squash the strawberries as much as you can. Tip into a bowl. Ask your grown-up helper to give you a hand if you need to.</description></item><item><title>Esquites</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/esquites/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/esquites/</guid><description>Mix all the ingredients in a glass.

They&amp;rsquo;ll keep in the freezer for up to two months.
Take a six-hole lolly mould and push a cucumber slice and a mint leaf into each one. In a jug, stir the gin, tonic and sugar until the sugar dissolves and the tonic loses its fizz. Divide between the moulds, push in the lolly sticks and freeze for at least 4 hrs, or preferably overnight.</description></item><item><title>Gohan (Japanese rice)</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/gohan-rice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/gohan-rice/</guid><description>Use round or bomba rice (avoid basmati or long-grain rice).
Measure the rice and place it in a pot. Add plenty of water to the pot, stir quickly 2 or 3 times, and then discard the water. Add water again and wash the rice by hand, repeating this process 3-6 times (or until the water runs clear), and discarding the water each time. Add an equal amount of water to the washed rice, cover with a lid, and if you have time, I recommend letting the rice soak for 30 minutes.</description></item><item><title>Griddled halloumi with watermelon &amp; caper breadcrumbs</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/other-recipes/halloumi-watermelon-breadcrumbs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/other-recipes/halloumi-watermelon-breadcrumbs/</guid><description>This salad has a great interplay of textures, temperatures and flavours. Toss juicy watermelon with salty cheese, crispy breadcrumbs, capers, almonds and mint.
Cut the watermelon into either cubes or slices and transfer to a bowl with the very finely sliced shallots. Add 4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil and the balsamic, then season with fresh black pepper.
