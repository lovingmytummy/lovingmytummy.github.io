This will prevent them from getting too soggy with the toppings.
Assemble the Toast-Pizza: On each slice of bread, spread a thin layer of tomato sauce.
Add the Toppings: Place your favorite extra toppings over the tomato sauce.
Cover with Cheese: Sprinkle a generous amount of grated mozzarella cheese over the toppings.</description></item><item><title>Super Mexican pizza</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/en/recipe/super_mexican_pizza/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/en/recipe/super_mexican_pizza/</guid><description>Preheat the oven: Preheat to 220°C (430°F) or follow the pizza dough package instructions.
