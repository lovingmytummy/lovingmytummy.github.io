Avoid trimming the fat as it helps keep the pork juicy and flavorful during cooking.
Make the Marinade: In a bowl, combine sugar, salt, five-spice powder, white pepper, sesame oil, Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, molasses (or dark soy), garlic, and food coloring (if using). For an extra layer of flavor, add 1 teaspoon of oyster sauce.</description></item><item><title>Rattlesnake Tails</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/en/recipe/rattlesnake_tails/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/en/recipe/rattlesnake_tails/</guid><description>Preheat your smoker to 275°F (135°C). Score the hot dogs vertically and horizontally to give them a rattlesnake tail appearance. Slather the hot dogs with mustard to act as a binder for the seasoning. In a small bowl, mix together the smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and ground dried chiles. Coat the mustard-covered hot dogs thoroughly with the seasoning mix. Place the hot dogs on the smoker for about 20 minutes, allowing the cuts to open up.</description></item></channel></rss>
