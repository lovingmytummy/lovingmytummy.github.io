Score the hot dogs vertically and horizontally to give them a rattlesnake tail appearance. Slather the hot dogs with mustard to act as a binder for the seasoning. In a small bowl, mix together the smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and ground dried chiles. Coat the mustard-covered hot dogs thoroughly with the seasoning mix. Place the hot dogs on the smoker for about 20 minutes, allowing the cuts to open up.</description></item></channel></rss>
