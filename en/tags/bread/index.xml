If desired, add some grated Parmesan for extra flavor. Slice the bread: Cut the baguette or loaf into slices, making sure not to cut all the way through so the slices stay connected at the bottom.

Fill with olives: Place the sliced olives into the hollowed-out area of the bread.</description></item></channel></rss>
