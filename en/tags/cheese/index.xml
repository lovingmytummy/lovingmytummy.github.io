Melt the butter and mix it with the crushed cookies. Stir until the mixture resembles wet sand. Line the base of a 20 cm (8-inch) springform pan with parchment paper to prevent sticking. Press the cookie and butter mixture firmly into the bottom of the pan using the back of a spoon to create a compact and even base.</description></item><item><title>Quesadilla</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/en/recipe/quesadilla/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/en/recipe/quesadilla/</guid><description>As the main ingredient, you can use your favourite protein (chicken, turkey, tuna, salmon, etc.).
Place one tortilla in the air fryer. Cover with the main ingredient (e.g., chicken) and half of the cheese, spreading them evenly. Cover with the second tortilla. Place a metal rack on top to prevent the tortilla from flying off. Set the air fryer to 190째C (375째F) for 6 minutes. Halfway through, remove the rack, flip the quesadilla, cover with the remaining shredded cheese, and sprinkle with oregano.</description></item></channel></rss>
