If desired, add some grated Parmesan for extra flavor. Slice the bread: Cut the baguette or loaf into slices, making sure not to cut all the way through so the slices stay connected at the bottom. Spread the garlic butter: Using a knife or spoon, spread the garlic butter mixture between each slice and across the top of the bread.</description></item><item><title>Marry me chicken</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/en/recipe/marry_me_chicken/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/en/recipe/marry_me_chicken/</guid><description>Prepare and Sear the Chicken: Season the chicken thighs (or breasts) with salt and black pepper to taste. Heat 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken on both sides until golden brown and cooked through (approximately 6-8 minutes per side, depending on thickness). Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
Prepare the Sauce Base: In the same skillet, without cleaning it, add 1 more tablespoon of olive oil if needed.</description></item></channel></rss>
