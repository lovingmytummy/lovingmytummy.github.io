Drain them well and let them cool. Once they are cool, mash them well with a fork until you get a thick pur√©e. In a bowl, mix the mashed carrots with the shredded coconut until you get a smooth mixture. Crumble magdalenas or sponge cake into the mixture, enough to give the dough some consistency so it can be formed into balls.</description></item><item><title>Carrot &amp; Coconut cake</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/en/recipe/carrot_coconut_cake/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/en/recipe/carrot_coconut_cake/</guid><description>Grease a baking pan with a knob of butter and dust it with a bit of flour. Tap the pan to remove any excess flour. Using an electric mixer, beat the eggs with the sugar until well combined. Add the softened butter and continue mixing. Incorporate the shredded coconut and keep beating until everything is well blended. Peel and grate the carrots, then add them to the mixture, stirring with a spoon.</description></item></channel></rss>
