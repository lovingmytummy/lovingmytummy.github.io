Drain them well and let them cool. Once they are cool, mash them well with a fork until you get a thick purée. In a bowl, mix the mashed carrots with the shredded coconut until you get a smooth mixture. Crumble magdalenas or sponge cake into the mixture, enough to give the dough some consistency so it can be formed into balls.</description></item><item><title>Carrot &amp; Coconut cake</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/en/recipe/carrot_coconut_cake/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/en/recipe/carrot_coconut_cake/</guid><description>Grease a baking pan with a knob of butter and dust it with a bit of flour.
