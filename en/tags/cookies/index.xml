I even recommend using ground oats as flour, in addition to the oat flakes.
Preheat the oven with two baking trays lined with parchment paper. Mix the butter, sugar, and egg in a bowl. Add the remaining ingredients to the mixture except for the chocolate, and mix with a dough utensil until fully combined.

Add milk: Open the package slightly and pour in milk until it fills the package. Mix gently by shaking. Insert the stick: Pierce the package with the wooden stick, positioning it in the center. Freeze: Place the package in the freezer and let it freeze completely (about 4-6 hours).

Add the egg, oat flour, vanilla extract, and cocoa powder. Stir until you have a smooth, thick batter.
Shape the Cookie: Form a large cookie shape with the batter, or divide it into smaller portions if you prefer multiple cookies. Place parchment paper in the air fryer basket to prevent sticking.
Cook in the Air Fryer: Preheat the air fryer to 180째C (350째F).</description></item></channel></rss>
