Drain well and let them cool. Crush the cookies into fine crumbs. Mix them with the melted butter and cocoa powder until you get a uniform dough. Press this mixture firmly into the bottom of a rectangular tray or pan to form the base. Chill in the fridge. Once the carrots are cold, mash them with a fork or blend them until you get a thick pur√©e.</description></item></channel></rss>
