Sauté them in a pan with the butter, ginger, and cinnamon for 8–10 minutes, stirring occasionally. In a bowl, mix the fresh cheese (quark or similar) with the vanilla extract, ground chia seeds, and rolled oats. In a glass container, alternate layers of warm apple with the cheese mixture. Top with frozen raspberries and serve chilled or slightly warm.</description></item><item><title>Carrot cake with cookie and cocoa base</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/en/recipe/carrot_cookie_cake/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/en/recipe/carrot_cookie_cake/</guid><description>Slice the carrots and boil them in a little water for about 15 minutes until soft. Drain well and let them cool. Crush the cookies into fine crumbs. Mix them with the melted butter and cocoa powder until you get a uniform dough. Press this mixture firmly into the bottom of a rectangular tray or pan to form the base. Chill in the fridge. Once the carrots are cold, mash them with a fork or blend them until you get a thick purée.</description></item></channel></rss>
