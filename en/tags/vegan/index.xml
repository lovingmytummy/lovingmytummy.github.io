Cut, peel and pit the avocado. We recommend cutting the avocado in half and removing the flesh with a large spoon. Cut it into chunks and place it in a bowl where you are going to beat it. Add the milk, sweetener, and cinnamon. If you want to try it with banana, now is the time to add it too. Whisk everything together (carefully so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t splash). Tips: If you find it too thick or liquid, you can correct it by adding more milk or avocado.</description></item><item><title>Blueberries &amp; banana crumpets</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/en/recipe/blueberries_banana_crumpets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/en/recipe/blueberries_banana_crumpets/</guid><description>Mash the bananas, add the flour and baking powder, and knead well.

Measure the rice and place it in a pot. Add plenty of water to the pot, stir quickly 2 or 3 times, and then discard the water. Add water again and wash the rice by hand, repeating this process 3-6 times (or until the water runs clear), and discarding the water each time. Add an equal amount of water to the washed rice, cover with a lid, and if you have time, I recommend letting the rice soak for 30 minutes.</description></item><item><title>Mini Chocolate Tartlets</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/en/recipe/mini_chocolate_tartlets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/en/recipe/mini_chocolate_tartlets/</guid><description>For 2 small tartlets.
