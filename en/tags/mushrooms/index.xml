It&amp;rsquo;s important not to remove the skin in this case, as they could burn (especially if cooked in a pan). Take a handful of parsley and as many garlic cloves as you think necessary, depending on how many mushrooms you want to prepare. Finely chop the garlic and parsley, and let them marinate with a good drizzle of olive oil.</description></item></channel></rss>
