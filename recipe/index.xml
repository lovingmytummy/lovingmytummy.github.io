Measure the rice and place it in a pot. Add plenty of water to the pot, stir quickly 2 or 3 times, and then discard the water. Add water again and wash the rice by hand, repeating this process 3-6 times (or until the water runs clear), and discarding the water each time. Add an equal amount of water to the washed rice, cover with a lid, and if you have time, I recommend letting the rice soak for 30 minutes.</description></item><item><title>Lentils donettes</title><link>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/lentils_donettes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lovingmytummy.github.io/recipe/lentils_donettes/</guid><description>Quantities for 28 small donuts.
